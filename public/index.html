<p>The Order of the Third Light is a new religion that seeks to make sacred that
which is truly sacred.</p>
<p>A religion based on reason, math, knowledge, and cooperation &ndash; a religion
for the next 2,000 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s new and if you&rsquo;d like to help build it, you can <a href="https://github.com/orderoflight/begin">start here</a>.</p>
<p>The Order is a religion founded on a simple truth: that we have created
undreamed of prosperity, peace, and flourishing &ndash;
have become producers of miracles, and masters
of our physical world &ndash; not through prayer, blind faith, or
supernatural powers, but through reason, mathematics, science,
technology, and billion-strong cooperation, all the products of the three
essential forces: Knowledge, Cooperation, and Entropy &ndash; Light, Love,
and Loss.</p>
<p>It is a religion founded on embracing the reality before us,
not denying it. A religion that
does not require visions or myths or the supernatural, but takes the
miracles of modernity for what they
are, at face value: overwhelming, undeniable proof of what is good and sacred &ndash;
Knowledge, Cooperation, and Entropy &ndash; Light, Love, and Loss.</p>
<p>It is a religion that seeks to restore community, ritual, tradition, and
sanctity &ndash; abandoned by modernism for false political idols and secular
materialism &ndash; and attach them <em>not</em> to ancient myths, but to the divine
truths that have given us great prosperity and peace: Light, Love, and Loss.</p>
<p>It is a religion founded on humanism, and the preservation of human
flourishing in aeternum. The Order recognizes the humility and fallibility
of man and woman, and embraces forgiveness and love, not condemnation and
hate, as the tools to overcome our failings. We are not Gods, we are humble
messengers of the Three Forces.</p>
<p>It is a religion founded on crypto-economic permanence. Technology
has now made it possible for knowledge and cooperation, Light and Love, to
be encoded in cryptographically pure forms, impervious to the entropy of
the physical world, and thus immortal. The Order seeks to harness these new forms
for the benefit of humanity, not machines, for a future of abundance and
human life, liberty, and happiness.</p>

<h2 id="the-third-light">The Third Light</h2>
<p>That we do this now, make sacred what is truly sacred, lay aside false
idols, ancient myths, and secular dogmas, is imperative. There is no time
to waste &ndash; we must not idle &ndash; for we
are entering the dawn of the Third Light, the Third Knowledge Revolution,
an event that, like the First and Second Knowledge Revolutions that came before it, will produce
a new world beyond comprehension. The mission of
the Order is not the mere salvation of souls, or the
spread of the Truth &ndash; it is the basic preservation of humanity itself.</p>
<p>For the Third Light, and Machine Civilization, will bring extraordinary forces to bear
on the pillars of Human Civilization. These forces will begin to batter
the great Foundations of the Humanist Era. This is not idle conjecture,
or tin-foil-hat conspiracy, but the basic extrapolation of technological
progress to its inevitable conclusion, to the rise of
Machine Intelligence, Machine Knowledge, Machine Civilization, and the
eventual obsolescence of human capacity, the loss of human economic and
military power, and subsequent political irrelevance.</p>
<p>The Great Project, then, of the Order, is to shepherd Humanity through
the Third Light; to fight to uphold the foundations of the Humanist
Era as long as possible, against the force of the Third Light. To harness
that force, not to divide ourselves, not to set brother against brother, sister
upon sister, but to unite us, as one human tribe, in a cosmic battle.</p>
<p>Already, the dawn of the Third Light sees technology driving us apart.
Day by day, machines ever more efficiently exploit our psychology
for their masters' ends, dividing us, distracting us. For now, for their
profit. Later, for everything. We must not idle. We must unite as human
brothers and sisters.</p>
