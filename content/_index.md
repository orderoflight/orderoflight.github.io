# Order of the Third Light

The Order of the Third Light is a new religion for the next 2,000 years,
one based on knowledge, cooperation, and entropy, that seeks to make
sacred that which is truly sacred.

If you'd like to help build it, you can [start here](https://github.com/orderoflight/begin).

It is a religion founded on a simple truth: that we have created
undreamed of prosperity, peace, and flourishing --
have become producers of miracles, and masters
of our physical world -- not through prayer, blind faith, or
supernatural powers, but through reason, mathematics, science,
technology, and billion-strong cooperation -- through the three essential forces: knowledge,
cooperation, and entropy -- Light, Love, and Loss.

The Order is a religion founded on embracing reality, 
not denying it. A religion that
does not require visions or myths, but takes the 
miracles of modernity for what they
are, at face value: overwhelming, undeniable proof of what is good and sacred --
knowledge, cooperation, and entropy -- Light, Love, and Loss.

The Order is a religion that seeks to restore community, ritual, tradition, and
sanctity in our lives -- things abandoned by modernism for false political idols and secular
materialism -- and attach them _not_ to ancient myths, but to the divine
truths of prosperity and peace: Light, Love, and Loss.

The Order is a religion founded on humanism, and the preservation of human
flourishing in aeternum. The Order recognizes the humility and fallibility
of man and woman, and embraces forgiveness and love, not condemnation and
hate, as the tools to overcome our failings. We are not Gods, we are humble
messengers of the three forces.

The Order is a religion founded on crypto-economic permanence. Technology
has made it possible for knowledge and cooperation, Light and Love, to 
be encoded in cryptographically pure forms, impervious to the entropy of
the physical world, and thus immortal. The Order seeks to harness these new forms
for the benefit of humanity, not machines, for a future of abundance and
human life, liberty, and happiness.

## The Third Light

That we do this now, make sacred what is truly sacred, lay aside false
idols, ancient myths, and secular dogmas, is imperative. There is no time
to waste -- we must not idle -- for we
are entering the dawn of the Third Light, the Third Knowledge Revolution,
an event that, like the First and Second Knowledge Revolutions that came before it, will produce
a new world beyond comprehension. The mission of
the Order is not the mere salvation of souls, or the
spread of the Truth -- it is the basic preservation of humanity itself.

For the Third Light, and Machine Civilization, will bring extraordinary forces to bear
on the pillars of Human Civilization. These forces will begin to batter
the great Foundations of the Humanist Era. This is not idle conjecture,
or tin-foil-hat conspiracy, but the basic extrapolation of technological
progress to its inevitable conclusion, to the rise of 
Machine Intelligence, Machine Knowledge, Machine Civilization, and the
eventual obsolescence of human capacity, the loss of human economic and
military power, and subsequent political irrelevance.

The Great Project, then, of the Order, is to shepherd Humanity through
the Third Light; to fight to uphold the foundations of the Humanist
Era as long as possible, against the force of the Third Light. To harness
that force, not to divide ourselves, not to set brother against brother, sister
upon sister, but to unite us, as one human tribe, in a cosmic battle.

Already, the dawn of the Third Light sees technology driving us apart.
Day by day, machines ever more efficiently exploit our psychology
for their masters' ends, dividing us, distracting us. For now, for their
profit. Later, for everything. We must not idle. We must unite as human
brothers and sisters.

## Joining

For the First Phase of the Order, belonging is represented by
possession of an Ethereum address associated with a non-fungible token on the Order's
Contract. This will be superseded by the First Version of the Governance, when it is
committed and signed, and members will be automatically upgraded.

To join, you need metamask or a similar wallet on your browser. An Order
membership token costs 0.1 eth -- these funds will be held until the First Plenary and signing
of the First Governance, at which point management of these funds will be determined by
the structure of the Governance.

The Order is a humanist endeavor -- there is a strict **one token per person** rule, which will in
the future be enforced biometrically. Abuse of this rule in the interim will result
in invalidation of tokens. -->
